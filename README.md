# Project Rebuild

**Project Rebuild** is my long-term initiative to strengthen and expand my computer science foundation through structured lessons, coding challenges, and projects. The repository serves as a living portfolio of my growth in software engineering, highlighting both academic and self-directed work.

## Purpose

The goal of Project Rebuild is to:
- Reinforce core computer science concepts (OOP, data structures, algorithms).
- Apply skills through progressively more complex coding challenges.
- Build a body of work that demonstrates readiness for software engineering roles.
- Track progress in a transparent, structured way.

## Structure

The repository is organized into **stages**, each containing:
- **Lessons** â†’ Focused study on a core topic (variables, conditionals, OOP, etc.).
- **Homework** â†’ Short coding exercises reinforcing each lesson.
- **Projects** â†’ Larger, applied builds (e.g., calculator, contact manager, student system).
- **Progress Tracking** â†’ XP system and confidence meter to measure readiness.

## Highlights

Some notable completed projects include:
- **Number Quest (Java)** â†’ A console-based number game reinforcing loops and conditionals.
- **Task Management System (Java)** â†’ Built using OOP principles, handling user-defined tasks with CRUD operations.
- **Student/Professor System (Java)** â†’ Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism by modeling people and roles within an academic environment.
- **Water Tracker App (SwiftUI)** â†’ A personal iOS app to track daily water intake, with custom UI and animations.

Each project is written from scratch, documented, and pushed to this repository for version control and review.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Languages**: Java, Python, Swift, JavaScript  
- **Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, UI Development  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, MySQL  

## Progress

Project Rebuild is ongoing. Each stage builds upon the last, with consistent updates to lessons, homework, and projects. The ultimate goal is to reach a **hire-ready confidence level** through measurable progress and a portfolio of completed work.
