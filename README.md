# Project Rebuild

**Project Rebuild** is my personal initiative to rebuild my computer science foundation from the ground up. The repository documents structured lessons, coding challenges, and projects that strengthen my skills in Java and core CS concepts.

## Purpose

The goal of Project Rebuild is to:
- Reinforce fundamentals in computer science and software engineering.
- Practice problem-solving through lessons, exercises, and projects.
- Build a body of work that demonstrates growth, discipline, and readiness for software engineering roles.
- Track measurable progress through an XP system and a hire-ready confidence meter.

## Structure

The repository is organized into **stages**, each containing:
- **Lessons** â†’ Core concepts (variables, loops, methods, OOP, inheritance, etc.).  
- **Homework** â†’ Small exercises reinforcing the lesson.  
- **Projects** â†’ Larger builds applying multiple concepts.  
- **Progress Tracking** â†’ XP points and a hire-ready confidence meter.

## Highlights

Some completed projects include:
- **Number Quest (Java)** â†’ A console-based number game reinforcing loops and conditionals.  
- **Calculator (Java)** â†’ Implements encapsulation, input handling, and menu-driven logic.  
- **Contact Manager (Java)** â†’ Uses collections and hashing for efficient data storage and retrieval.  
- **Task Management System (Java)** â†’ CRUD-based task tracker applying OOP principles.  
- **Student/Professor System (Java)** â†’ Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism with academic roles.

Each project is written from scratch and pushed to this repository with version control.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Languages**: Java  
- **Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Data Structures, Algorithms, Problem Solving  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, InteliJ IDE

## Progress

Project Rebuild is ongoing. Each stage builds upon the last, with regular updates to lessons, homework, and projects. The ultimate goal is to achieve hire-ready confidence through consistent practice and a portfolio of completed work.
